/// @brief Interface for Extension of the DD4hep \a DetElement needed for
/// translation into Acts tracking geometry
///
/// Interface class for making extensions to the DD4hep \a DetElement class,
/// needed  for the translation from the DD4hep geometry into the tracking
/// geometry of the Acts package.
///
/// This extensions are necessary in order to distinguish in the translation if
/// a DD4hep \a DetElement is
/// 	- the beampipe
///		- a barrel volume
///		- an endcap volume
/// 	- a layer
/// and to hand over needed parameters.
///
/// Every DD4hep \a DetElement containing sensitive DD4hep \a DetElements has to
/// be declared as a layer.
/// However, the layer does not need to be the direct mother
/// of these sensitive DD4hep \a DetElements - they can also be nested in other
/// DD4hep \a DetElement substructures. Moreover every DD4hep \a DetElement
/// layer which should carry material should also be declared as layer and the
/// specific parameters needed for material mapping should be handed over.
/// In case the sensitive modules/components contained by a layer have a
/// different orientation in respect to the local tracking frame of Acts, the
/// axes orientation of these modules can be set for the layer.
/// In case the segmentation is set for the module (by using the second
/// constructor setting the segmentation or using the setSegmentation()
/// function), the axes do not need to be set for the layer, which containes
/// the modules.
///
/// In DD4hep cylinder and disc volumes are both described with the underlying
/// ROOT TGeoConeSeg class. In Acts one needs to distinguish these two volume
/// types. Therefore volumes which are endcaps or barrels should be indicated as
/// these.
/// The ActsExtension should also be used to indicate that a \a DetElement is
/// the
/// beampipe.
///
/// @note see Acts::ActsExtension for implementation.
