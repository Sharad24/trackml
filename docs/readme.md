### Overview

Hi, My name is Sharad Chitlangia and this is a webpage describing the details of my Google Summer of Code 2019 with CERN-HSF.

I worked on porting three Particle Track Reconstruction algorithms into acts-framework and exploring few other tasks. ACTS stands for A Common Tracking Software aims to provide a set of tools for the ATLAS experiment encapsulating track reconstruction software into a generic, framework- and experiment-independent software package. The three Track Reconstruction algorithms were exposed in the recent competitions on trackml hosted on Kaggle and Codalab. They are described in a bit more details below.
