### Overview

Hi, My name is Sharad Chitlangia and this is a webpage describing the details of my Google Summer of Code 2019 with CERN-HSF.

I worked on porting three Particle Track Reconstruction algorithms into acts-framework and exploring few other tasks. ACTS stands for A Common Tracking Software aims to provide a set of tools for the ATLAS experiment encapsulating track reconstruction software into a generic, framework- and experiment-independent software package. The three Track Reconstruction algorithms were exposed in the recent competitions on trackml hosted on Kaggle and Codalab. They are described in a bit more details below.

### 1. Data

The Data is created through highly accurate simulation of proton proton beam collisions using the acts-framework. Sample Data can be generated by running the `ACTFWGenericFatrasExample` binary. There are about a 100,000 hits and around 10,000 tracks to recontruct in the data provided in the official competitions but the parameters for different amounts of pileup can be set using program options of `ACTFWGenericFatrasExample` binary. An image of a sample event is shown below. The hits are in white and tracks are in red.

### 2. Top-quarks Tracker

This tracker stood 1st in the competition held on Kaggle. It is one of the most elegant solutions in the sense that it utilises the features of the geometry of detectors efficiently which not a lot of other solutions from the first phase of the competition on Kaggle did. The complete tracking can be divided into 5 different steps:
1. Pair Prediction
2. Triplet Prediction
3. Extension of Triplets to Tracks
4. Addition of duplicates to tracks
5. Final track assignment

The final 3 steps utilise a unique Outlier Density Estimation Method which is also used by one of the top performers of the second phase. 

This algorithm can be run in the framework in the example binaries by appending the algorithm to the Sequencer. It's important to set the right paths for the data in the code before trying to run them.
